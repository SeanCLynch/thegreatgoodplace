Finding Your 'Kinky' Tribe

The first time I remember having a personal philosophy was in 10th grade english class. My teacher, Dr. P (yes, that is what he went by), for reasons I cannot remember gave me Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut. I voraciously read it, and was fascinated by Bokononism. And most influentially by the saying that captures the part of spirituality that I like - the encouragement to do good to others and yourself:

"Live by the foma that make you brave and kind and happy and healthy."

The next step on my journey was stepping into Absurdism. In 11th grade we read The Stranger by Albert Camus. I've studied the last few pages of that text at many points in my life, and they have always enduced a calming sensation for me. The following passage especially:  

"It was as if that great rush of anger had washed me clean, emptied me of hope, and, gazing up at the dark sky spangled with its signs and stars, for the first time, the first, I laid my heart open to the benign indifference of the universe. To feel it so like myself, indeed, so brotherly, made me realize that I'd been happy, and that I was happy still."

Of course, Absurdism itself is still something that interests me spiritually. The idea of finding meaning in such a complex and unknown universe can very easily seem bound to fail at times. 

Yet in the next few years, I developed this strange need to "find your passion". Wrestling with light anxiety and depression I think in some ways contributed to this new idea of finding meaning. I was, and still am, fascinated with what drives people to achieve and prosper. And I guess I found an answer in the idea of passion, some kind of internal drive and love of what you do. But I think there are factors that make passion sound impossible. How can a person invest themselves so fully into one activity? Is there not something to be said for variety and interdisciplinary adventures? I think the idea of externally focusing so much into one "passion" is an unhealthy interaction with the universe. It is a little like putting on blinders in some ways. Not saying there are not any benefits, but it does have its flaws too. 

Most recently, and somewhat due to the two links at the beginning of this post, I have become intrigued by a somewhat more internally focused way to find meaning. The idea of finding a principle. Now I recognize the similarity with finding a passion. But the distinction comes I think is focusing on finding meaning internally vs externally. Finding an inner principle to guide your actions is different than finding an external action.

And now I can talk about the title haha. After this long journey for meaning in life, I have come to this concept - principles. That does not mean that I have forsaken any of the old concepts, I still like foma, absurdism and passion. But a meaning that is self created seems like a nice option at the moment.

After a little bit of reflection and looking at what I have been doing with my life, I think one common theme that I consistently believe in is helping others to do what they believe in. In this day and age, there is no reason not to be doing what you love. Moreover, I believe that there exists a community that also loves what your doing. Finding your kinky tribe is how I state these beliefs. Kinky in that it is unique and not necessarily mainstream (and it doesn't matter how weird your real interests are!), and a tribe because these people should encourage and support you. In a world that is increasing losing sight of the value of community, finding a tribe can help the mental and spiritual health in ways we as a society have almost forgotten. I want to help people, I want to enable people, encourage them, connect them to people who believe and support them. I think when people are doing what they really like, and doing it with the support of others, we observe amazing creation - creations that are markers of what human society can become.

Now that sounds great and all, but I am young. I am not sure that this is something I can believe in forever. Maybe there are flaws I cannot see. But for now I think it works nicely. Brikwars, Minecrack, E-Sports, AoE2, and so many other communities exist and support people who have committed themselves to these engines of creation. I think that is beautiful. And I think finding your kinky tribe is something everyone needs to think about. And in the meantime we will see how long this part of the spiritual journey lasts.
